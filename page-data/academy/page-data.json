The price rises, however, are relentless. August's Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.6% (MoM), above forecasts. Other CPI measures also rose, resulting in expectations of a 100 basis points rate hike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EUR/USD fell and only made tiny recoveries in response to poor US data, such as disappointing retail sales estimates. In nominal terms, inflation is outpacing consumption.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With respect to the monetary policy, European Central Bank (ECB) officials overwhelmingly endorsed a substantial rate increase in October. This contrasts with ECB President Christine Lagarde's more nuanced stance following the recent rate decision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the euro is fighting hard, the US dollar seems to be holding on tight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The GBP/USD failed to maintain its bounce, falling roughly by 200 pips. The pair finished the week in the negative, trading below $1.1500. The decline in the pair's prices could be due to disappointing retail sales in the UK. Sales volumes in the retail sector declined by 1.6% in August, continuing with the summer of 2021 trend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week will be important for the markets as the Fed and Bank of England decide on interest rate hikes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/991cfa90-ca1d-41a0-bcb9-e7c4f2e6d6ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/991cfa90-ca1d-41a0-bcb9-e7c4f2e6d6ab?width=2258&amp;height=1130\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As the US dollar continued to rise, gold dropped to its lowest level since April 2020 and finished the week at a notably lower price of $1,675, just under 3% from its price at the start of the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, the expectation of a significant rate hike by the Fed on Wednesday, 21 September 2022, appeared to be a crucial factor exerting downward pressure on gold on the final day of the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, silver prices began trading at around $18 and ended at approximately $20. Despite growing concerns that the US central bank's tightening might cause a recession, US economic statistics showed that consumer sentiment continued to improve, driving up this precious metal's price.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI prices hovered around $85 due to fears of a long-term decline in global energy demand. Because of the same reasons mentioned above, oil prices have fallen by around a quarter in the last 3 months.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund warned of an imminent global economic downturn in late 2022/23, weighing on morale. Furthermore, the strong US inflation data released earlier last week boosted the US dollar, which hurt the market (because oil is traded in US dollars, making it costlier for overseas customers).</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/cd837cf3-d1fb-4e75-9c64-1e8091fbd0ee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/cd837cf3-d1fb-4e75-9c64-1e8091fbd0ee?width=2264&amp;height=1130\" alt=\"Bitcoin Chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The rising US Treasury bond yield, hawkish Fed comments, and the rise in the US dollar's prices weighed down gold's performance. The pair struggled to recover and ended up losing more than 2% on a weekly basis.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week will be important for gold, focusing on Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Chairman Jerome Powell's speech. If Powell fights against the market's expectation of the Fed becoming dovish in the second half of 2023, the US dollar should be able to excel and will drive gold further down. On the other hand, if the chairman suggests a 50bps rate hike in September rather than a 75 bps increase, US T-bond rates might plummet and may pave the way for a strong rally in gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil dipped for the week due to a strong US dollar and fears that an economic slowdown will limit demand.

Other CPI measures also rose, resulting in expectations of a 100 basis points rate hike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EUR/USD fell and only made tiny recoveries in response to poor US data, such as disappointing retail sales estimates.

Following a period of stabilisation, the market suffered a substantial drop, much to traders' surprise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin was trading at around the mid-$21,000 level for most of the week. However, over the weekend, Bitcoin was at the forefront of all the occurrences as the coin plummeted below the $20,000 mark for the first time since mid-July. This significant drop may have occurred due to concerns about the Fed's rate-hike path post the Jackson Hole speech. &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier this month, the $20,000 level acted as a support level for Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency even went on to surpass the $25,000 mark.

Despite the dangers such choices pose to economic development, the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) increased interest rates by 75bps.</p>\n<p>Rising tensions between the European Union (EU) and Russia also dealt another blow to the EUR/USD pair.

The rate rise decisions by the Fed and the Bank of England highlighted the expanding policy divergence, while the Bank of England (BOE) disappointed the markets by raising interest rates by just 50bps instead of 75bps. This contributed to the pair's weekly loss of almost 400 pips.</p>\n<p>This week will focus on the speeches from ECB President Christine Lagarde and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.

Meanwhile, Ethereum dropped below $1,300, losing nearly 12% in the previous seven days. One of the major factors that contributed to this drop was the Ethereum switch to a proof-of-stake network, which may lead to future regulations on ETH.</p>\n<p>In other news, Warren Buffett has criticised cryptocurrencies, claiming they have no fundamental value.

A stock index usually consists of a set number of the top stocks of a particular exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a trader, understanding how to measure stock market indices is important as it helps you assess the performance of a particular stock market, and through that, you can predict the pattern of stock market prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note the change in value over time&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common way to read an index is to note the changes in its values over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, the value of a stock market index is based on the value of the individual stocks that make up that index. Because these prices change often, each stock market index is unique and no two are completely alike.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With different stocks and varying calculations, it is worth noting that every new stock market index has different starting values, and should not be measured against each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it in perspective, if one index goes up 300 points a day while the other goes up only 50, you may think that the first index performed better than the second. However, if the first index was initially 50,000 while the second index started at 500, then the second index had done better in terms of percentage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With stock market indices, you should focus on the percentage of rise and fall instead of its point value, as a higher percentage gain means a bigger profit, while a higher percentage loss signifies a bigger loss.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that most stock market indices do not measure the performance of the entire market but only show the general health of the sector, industry or economy they represent. Therefore, you can find out how each stock contributes to the index by understanding which stocks make up that particular index and how they are weighted.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the weightage of the indices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To recap, there are three types of weighted indices, which are market-capitalisation-weighted, equal-weighted, and price-weighted indices. They are categorised according to how the stocks influence the overall market index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To properly read stock market indices, you&rsquo;d need to know how much weight each individual stock would have on the index. There are separate ways of reading and analysing different weighted indices. This part will explore how each weighted index could be read.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the most common index weighting, market-capitalisation-weighted indices consider stocks with a larger market capitalisation to have more influence and a bigger weightage on the overall market index. These indices represent what a trader would earn if they purchased stocks of every company in the index.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s look at an example index that consists of Company A, Company B, and Company C. Let&rsquo;s say these companies have 7,500, 2,000, and 500 stocks respectively, each of their stocks priced at USD10, USD100, and USD500. In this example, Company A would have a lower market capitalisation at USD75,000, followed by Company B at USD200,000, leaving Company C with the highest market capitalisation at USD250,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Company C&rsquo;s stocks rise, it would have more of an impact on the value and percentage of the index compared to Company A having the same rise in stock prices. In the same way, if Company C&rsquo;s stocks plummet, the value of this index will be more affected than if it were a huge decline in Company A&rsquo;s stocks.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices, as their name suggests, are affected equally by every company they consist of.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find the value of this index, each of these companies&rsquo; individual stocks would be multiplied by the weight each company carries (calculated according to the number of companies in the index), and summed up to get the index value.</span></p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 34.8192%;\">Equal-weighted index of Companies A, B, and C</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.1808%;\">(USD 10 x 33.3%) + (USD 100 x 33.3%) + (USD 500 x 33.3%)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at the example above, there are 3 companies, which means each company would share one-third of the weight or 33.3% each. Following this formula, the index value would be USD203.13.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like market-capitalisation-weighted indices, the value of price-weighted indices depend on the price of each individual stock. The difference is that with these indices, the price of each individual stock determines the percentage of influence it has on the index (with market-capitalisation-weighted indices, the number of stocks the company has also influences the index).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s look at the weightage of each company from the example above if they were price-weighted.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 115.5px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 115.5px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 34.9053%; height: 115.5px;\">Weight of Company A</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.0947%; height: 115.5px;\">\n<p>USD10 / (USD10 + USD100 + USD500) x 100%&nbsp;</p>\n<p>=&nbsp; <strong>2%</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 115.5px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 115.5px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 34.9053%; height: 115.5px;\">Weight of Company B</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.0947%; height: 115.5px;\">\n<p>USD100 / (USD10 + USD100 + USD500) x 100%&nbsp;</p>\n<p>=&nbsp; <strong>16%</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 115.5px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 115.5px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 34.9053%; height: 115.5px;\">Weight of Company C</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.0947%; height: 115.5px;\">\n<p>USD500 / (USD10 + USD100 + USD500) x 100%&nbsp;</p>\n<p>= &nbsp;<strong>82%</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the calculations above, the stocks in Company C would have more influence on the value of the index than in Company A and B.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if there is a minor spike in Company C&rsquo;s stock prices, it would have a bigger effect on the overall stock index compared to a similar spike in Company A&rsquo;s or B&rsquo;s.

The price rises, however, are relentless. August's Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.6% (MoM), above forecasts. Other CPI measures also rose, resulting in expectations of a 100 basis points rate hike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EUR/USD fell and only made tiny recoveries in response to poor US data, such as disappointing retail sales estimates. In nominal terms, inflation is outpacing consumption.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With respect to the monetary policy, European Central Bank (ECB) officials overwhelmingly endorsed a substantial rate increase in October. This contrasts with ECB President Christine Lagarde's more nuanced stance following the recent rate decision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the euro is fighting hard, the US dollar seems to be holding on tight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The GBP/USD failed to maintain its bounce, falling roughly by 200 pips. The pair finished the week in the negative, trading below $1.1500. The decline in the pair's prices could be due to disappointing retail sales in the UK. Sales volumes in the retail sector declined by 1.6% in August, continuing with the summer of 2021 trend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week will be important for the markets as the Fed and Bank of England decide on interest rate hikes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/991cfa90-ca1d-41a0-bcb9-e7c4f2e6d6ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/991cfa90-ca1d-41a0-bcb9-e7c4f2e6d6ab?width=2258&amp;height=1130\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Despite growing concerns that the US central bank's tightening might cause a recession, US economic statistics showed that consumer sentiment continued to improve, driving up this precious metal's price.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI prices hovered around $85 due to fears of a long-term decline in global energy demand. Because of the same reasons mentioned above, oil prices have fallen by around a quarter in the last 3 months.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund warned of an imminent global economic downturn in late 2022/23, weighing on morale.

As expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised rates by 75 basis points. Additionally, the ECB pledged to keep raising rates as long as inflation remains high.

Now, the financial markets are unpredictable, but you can try to avoid these (and several other) trading mistakes by following this 4-step plan of action. These steps aren&rsquo;t foolproof but are a good way to help you develop the habit of making more responsible trading decisions.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1 &ndash; Planning what trades to <strong><em>start </em></strong>and when</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to what most people think, placing a potentially successful trade has less to do with luck and more to do with planning your trades in a disciplined manner. Your prediction needs to be thought out and based on fact-based research that includes a survey of market conditions. <br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare a trading plan that includes analysing current <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/search/?category=market-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global and economic events</a> and do your research on how markets are responding to them. If you have limited time for research and analysis, use lesser capital to trade 1 or a maximum of 2 markets simultaneously. This trading plan will help you analyse trading opportunities practically and objectively while also discovering which asset is better suited for your risk appetite.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2 &ndash; Planning what trades to </span><strong><em>end </em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and when</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every trader thinks of when to start a trade. Very few know how to analyse when to end it. Traders land up suffering more losses on losing trades in the hope that the market will reverse and the loss will turn into profit. A </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/fundamental-analysis-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fundamental</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technical</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exit strategy plan will help you avoid mistakes like emotional and impulsive trading or not cutting a losing trade. Key indicators like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/support-and-resistance-in-chart-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resistance and support</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lines are a fact-based way to understand market sentiment. Information on resistance and support lines can also highlight the range of an asset's price movement.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When placing trades, use this information to identify the prices at which you will close the trades &ndash; either to secure your potential profit or to limit losses if the market reverses. But more importantly, avoid changing your plan so you can handle any trade objectively if it doesn't go as planned.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3 &ndash; Use risk-management features</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading is a high-risk activity, and the best way to deal with a high-risk situation is to have a safety net even if you&rsquo;re fully geared up. That safety net is using</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risk-management features</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to secure your potential gains and control your losses when the market moves against you. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you&rsquo;re the type of trader who diversifies their portfolio with assets from different markets. In that case, you may not be able to monitor all assets&rsquo; price movements simultaneously and cut losses in time. In an instance like this, features like take profit and stop loss can help you secure your potential gains or cut losses before they become too much, especially when market conditions are volatile.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4 &ndash; Journal to learn about financial market trends and your trading style</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a journal to document the events of your trading day. Note down which trades were profitable and which weren&rsquo;t. Add notes against each of them, mentioning what data you based your prediction on and any insights or past learnings that impacted your decision-making process. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from helping you stay objective, this journal will be useful in understanding how markets respond to various global and economic events and discover </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/top-4-trading-styles-choose-the-one-that-suits-you-best/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what kind of a trader you are</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The spot prices reached new daily highs on Friday to close the week above the $1,700 level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dollar-denominated commodity found some strength due to 2 factors. First, the US dollar dropped from a two-decade high ahead of the closely watched US jobs report. Second, the mild drop in US Treasury bond yields after the release of the non-farm payrolls report further helped support its growth.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold crossed just above its resistance level of $1,710 at the end of the week, making this price the new support level.

Don&rsquo;t click on random links</strong>.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure that the URL begins with <strong>HTTPS</strong> and not HTTP, and always pay attention to the spelling, characters, and other irregularities that can be found in the URL. If you find that our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official website</a> doesn&rsquo;t begin with HTTPS, or that Deriv is spelt incorrectly, don&rsquo;t enter your personal information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you receive an email from a familiar organisation requesting you to confirm your login details on another website, try accessing the website without clicking on the link provided. Don&rsquo;t click on links that redirect you to an external website.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>2. Double-check message contents. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly examine the emails and messages you receive to confirm if the tone and content match those of the sender. Additionally, observe whether there are spelling and grammatical errors in the message. Most legitimate businesses carefully craft their messages before sending them to you (yes, that includes us!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice something fishy? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copy the content of the email and look it up on a search engine to check if it&rsquo;s a popular phishing scam, or get in touch with the sender through a phone call or alternate email address. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv will only contact you through <a href=\"mailto:no-reply@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no-reply@deriv.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">support@deriv.com</a>. So if you receive an email from us which did not come from these email addresses, contact us via <a href=\"https://deriv.com/contact_us/?is_livechat_open=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat</a> and report the email.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3. Shield yourself. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your operating systems and antivirus software are regularly updated. Our website and apps are constantly upgrading and improving, so keep your device up-to-date and consistently update your apps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also recommend using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection when trading with us, especially if you&rsquo;re accessing sensitive information.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>4. Turn off auto-connect settings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can avoid MitM attacks by ensuring your devices don&rsquo;t automatically connect to WiFi and Bluetooth networks. Better yet, turn your network settings off unless you need to use them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discourage connecting to public WiFi as hackers could create fake WiFi networks with names of legitimate individuals or businesses nearby. To ensure you are connecting to a real, secure, and reliable public WiFi network, double-check the WiFi credentials.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5. Set a strong password. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your password should be unique, containing a mixture of numbers, symbols, and uppercase and lowercase letters. Exclude personal information such as your name or birthdate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change your password regularly and try not to use the same password for multiple accounts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Password managers can help store your passwords and recommend stronger passwords. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, enable 2FA using your mobile device or email. Accounts that require a password and 2FA tend to be more secure than those only requiring passwords.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6. Be aware of your surroundings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never leave your belongings unattended. To avoid keyloggers from being implanted or infecting your device, always ensure your gadgets are within view and look out for odd electronics that seem out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t let your curiosity get the best of you if you find stray USB devices or external hard drives. You don&rsquo;t want to invite malware into your device yourself, do you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t fall victim to social engineering!

The rate rise decisions by the Fed and the Bank of England highlighted the expanding policy divergence, while the Bank of England (BOE) disappointed the markets by raising interest rates by just 50bps instead of 75bps.

A stock index usually consists of a set number of the top stocks of a particular exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a trader, understanding how to measure stock market indices is important as it helps you assess the performance of a particular stock market, and through that, you can predict the pattern of stock market prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note the change in value over time&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common way to read an index is to note the changes in its values over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, the value of a stock market index is based on the value of the individual stocks that make up that index. Because these prices change often, each stock market index is unique and no two are completely alike.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With different stocks and varying calculations, it is worth noting that every new stock market index has different starting values, and should not be measured against each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it in perspective, if one index goes up 300 points a day while the other goes up only 50, you may think that the first index performed better than the second. However, if the first index was initially 50,000 while the second index started at 500, then the second index had done better in terms of percentage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With stock market indices, you should focus on the percentage of rise and fall instead of its point value, as a higher percentage gain means a bigger profit, while a higher percentage loss signifies a bigger loss.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that most stock market indices do not measure the performance of the entire market but only show the general health of the sector, industry or economy they represent. Therefore, you can find out how each stock contributes to the index by understanding which stocks make up that particular index and how they are weighted.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the weightage of the indices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To recap, there are three types of weighted indices, which are market-capitalisation-weighted, equal-weighted, and price-weighted indices. They are categorised according to how the stocks influence the overall market index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To properly read stock market indices, you&rsquo;d need to know how much weight each individual stock would have on the index. There are separate ways of reading and analysing different weighted indices. This part will explore how each weighted index could be read.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the most common index weighting, market-capitalisation-weighted indices consider stocks with a larger market capitalisation to have more influence and a bigger weightage on the overall market index. These indices represent what a trader would earn if they purchased stocks of every company in the index.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s look at an example index that consists of Company A, Company B, and Company C. Let&rsquo;s say these companies have 7,500, 2,000, and 500 stocks respectively, each of their stocks priced at USD10, USD100, and USD500. In this example, Company A would have a lower market capitalisation at USD75,000, followed by Company B at USD200,000, leaving Company C with the highest market capitalisation at USD250,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Company C&rsquo;s stocks rise, it would have more of an impact on the value and percentage of the index compared to Company A having the same rise in stock prices. In the same way, if Company C&rsquo;s stocks plummet, the value of this index will be more affected than if it were a huge decline in Company A&rsquo;s stocks.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices, as their name suggests, are affected equally by every company they consist of.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find the value of this index, each of these companies&rsquo; individual stocks would be multiplied by the weight each company carries (calculated according to the number of companies in the index), and summed up to get the index value.</span></p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 34.8192%;\">Equal-weighted index of Companies A, B, and C</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.1808%;\">(USD 10 x 33.3%) + (USD 100 x 33.3%) + (USD 500 x 33.3%)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at the example above, there are 3 companies, which means each company would share one-third of the weight or 33.3% each. Following this formula, the index value would be USD203.13.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like market-capitalisation-weighted indices, the value of price-weighted indices depend on the price of each individual stock. The difference is that with these indices, the price of each individual stock determines the percentage of influence it has on the index (with market-capitalisation-weighted indices, the number of stocks the company has also influences the index).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s look at the weightage of each company from the example above if they were price-weighted.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 115.5px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 115.5px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 34.9053%; height: 115.5px;\">Weight of Company A</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.0947%; height: 115.5px;\">\n<p>USD10 / (USD10 + USD100 + USD500) x 100%&nbsp;</p>\n<p>=&nbsp; <strong>2%</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 115.5px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 115.5px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 34.9053%; height: 115.5px;\">Weight of Company B</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.0947%; height: 115.5px;\">\n<p>USD100 / (USD10 + USD100 + USD500) x 100%&nbsp;</p>\n<p>=&nbsp; <strong>16%</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; height: 115.5px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 115.5px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 34.9053%; height: 115.5px;\">Weight of Company C</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.0947%; height: 115.5px;\">\n<p>USD500 / (USD10 + USD100 + USD500) x 100%&nbsp;</p>\n<p>= &nbsp;<strong>82%</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the calculations above, the stocks in Company C would have more influence on the value of the index than in Company A and B.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if there is a minor spike in Company C&rsquo;s stock prices, it would have a bigger effect on the overall stock index compared to a similar spike in Company A&rsquo;s or B&rsquo;s. On the other hand, a minor dip in Company C&rsquo;s stock prices might have a similar effect on the index as a major dip in Company A&rsquo;s stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put this knowledge to the test by trading stock indices risk-free with our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The price rises, however, are relentless. August's Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.6% (MoM), above forecasts. Other CPI measures also rose, resulting in expectations of a 100 basis points rate hike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EUR/USD fell and only made tiny recoveries in response to poor US data, such as disappointing retail sales estimates. In nominal terms, inflation is outpacing consumption.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With respect to the monetary policy, European Central Bank (ECB) officials overwhelmingly endorsed a substantial rate increase in October. This contrasts with ECB President Christine Lagarde's more nuanced stance following the recent rate decision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the euro is fighting hard, the US dollar seems to be holding on tight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The GBP/USD failed to maintain its bounce, falling roughly by 200 pips.

On Tuesday, 13 September 2022, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalisation dropped from the $22,500 level to the $20,400 level, sending the crypto market into a frenzy. The coin experienced further losses during the week and is trading at $19,716.64 at the time of writing.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin's market value stood at around $370 billion, and the trade volume was approximately $30 billion.

The prices increased by 8.3%, higher than consensus predictions of a gain of around 8.1%. However, the increase in core inflation (excluding food and energy) was alarming. It reached 6.3%, its highest level since March and higher than the estimate of 6.1%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week's focus will be on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, as the Fed has emphasised lowering inflation over ensuring strong economic demand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading and the Deriv X platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</span></em></p>"},{"id":"01d7530e-950c-4532-a4cb-f7a57ed3786a","main_image":{"id":"24820b71-005c-4e29-89ef-60c51f414357","description":"Market News, Week 2, September 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#182828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/27e8cc233a596b5938554b4301ad293a/72127/Market%20news%2C%20Week%202%2C%20September%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/27e8cc233a596b5938554b4301ad293a/05ada/Market%20news%2C%20Week%202%2C%20September%202022.jpg 320w,\n/static/27e8cc233a596b5938554b4301ad293a/4eab0/Market%20news%2C%20Week%202%2C%20September%202022.jpg 640w,\n/static/27e8cc233a596b5938554b4301ad293a/72127/Market%20news%2C%20Week%202%2C%20September%202022.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/27e8cc233a596b5938554b4301ad293a/8e2ef/Market%20news%2C%20Week%202%2C%20September%202022.webp 320w,\n/static/27e8cc233a596b5938554b4301ad293a/0cc1c/Market%20news%2C%20Week%202%2C%20September%202022.webp 640w,\n/static/27e8cc233a596b5938554b4301ad293a/7a708/Market%20news%2C%20Week%202%2C%20September%202022.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"market-news-12-09-2022-18-09-2022","published_date":"2022-09-12","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"298","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Market news â€“ Week 2, September 2022","blog_description":"Last week, the financial markets were in recovery mode.

As expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised rates by 75 basis points. Additionally, the ECB pledged to keep raising rates as long as inflation remains high.

The solution to avoiding them lies in developing a structured and disciplined approach to trading, and this blog explains how to do it in 4 steps.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few of the most common mistakes traders make are&hellip;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/344ddd4b-d188-4a5c-a94e-37655b02f1ab?width=1280&amp;height=400\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/344ddd4b-d188-4a5c-a94e-37655b02f1ab?width=1280&amp;height=400\" alt=\"Revised Trading Mistakes (1)\" /></a></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&hellip;the list can go on. Now, the financial markets are unpredictable, but you can try to avoid these (and several other) trading mistakes by following this 4-step plan of action. These steps aren&rsquo;t foolproof but are a good way to help you develop the habit of making more responsible trading decisions.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1 &ndash; Planning what trades to <strong><em>start </em></strong>and when</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to what most people think, placing a potentially successful trade has less to do with luck and more to do with planning your trades in a disciplined manner. Your prediction needs to be thought out and based on fact-based research that includes a survey of market conditions. <br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare a trading plan that includes analysing current <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/search/?category=market-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global and economic events</a> and do your research on how markets are responding to them. If you have limited time for research and analysis, use lesser capital to trade 1 or a maximum of 2 markets simultaneously. This trading plan will help you analyse trading opportunities practically and objectively while also discovering which asset is better suited for your risk appetite.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2 &ndash; Planning what trades to </span><strong><em>end </em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and when</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every trader thinks of when to start a trade. Very few know how to analyse when to end it. Traders land up suffering more losses on losing trades in the hope that the market will reverse and the loss will turn into profit. A </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/fundamental-analysis-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fundamental</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technical</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exit strategy plan will help you avoid mistakes like emotional and impulsive trading or not cutting a losing trade. Key indicators like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/support-and-resistance-in-chart-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resistance and support</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lines are a fact-based way to understand market sentiment. Information on resistance and support lines can also highlight the range of an asset's price movement.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When placing trades, use this information to identify the prices at which you will close the trades &ndash; either to secure your potential profit or to limit losses if the market reverses. But more importantly, avoid changing your plan so you can handle any trade objectively if it doesn't go as planned.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3 &ndash; Use risk-management features</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading is a high-risk activity, and the best way to deal with a high-risk situation is to have a safety net even if you&rsquo;re fully geared up. That safety net is using</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risk-management features</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to secure your potential gains and control your losses when the market moves against you. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you&rsquo;re the type of trader who diversifies their portfolio with assets from different markets. In that case, you may not be able to monitor all assets&rsquo; price movements simultaneously and cut losses in time. In an instance like this, features like take profit and stop loss can help you secure your potential gains or cut losses before they become too much, especially when market conditions are volatile.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4 &ndash; Journal to learn about financial market trends and your trading style</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a journal to document the events of your trading day. Note down which trades were profitable and which weren&rsquo;t. Add notes against each of them, mentioning what data you based your prediction on and any insights or past learnings that impacted your decision-making process. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from helping you stay objective, this journal will be useful in understanding how markets respond to various global and economic events and discover </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/top-4-trading-styles-choose-the-one-that-suits-you-best/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what kind of a trader you are</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the long run, you will learn to avoid trading mistakes, sharpen your trading skills, and develop a trading plan that suits your trading style.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above 4 steps can help beginner and seasoned traders refine their trading skills through constant learning, practise, and discipline. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you are unsure which market to trade, how to use risk-management features, or want to test a trading strategy, practise risk-free with a demo account, which is preloaded with virtual funds. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sign up</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today so you can try out these steps.</span></p>"},{"id":"5ed3d1d2-9255-4a93-9edc-e29dd067c8f0","main_image":{"id":"8e596cfd-8b39-4b14-8f9a-03315c22ce55","description":"Market News, Week 1, September 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5567a3fdfc8ce5b99c420274ea8cb7c8/72127/Market%20news%2C%20week%201%2C%20September%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5567a3fdfc8ce5b99c420274ea8cb7c8/05ada/Market%20news%2C%20week%201%2C%20September%202022.jpg 320w,\n/static/5567a3fdfc8ce5b99c420274ea8cb7c8/4eab0/Market%20news%2C%20week%201%2C%20September%202022.jpg 640w,\n/static/5567a3fdfc8ce5b99c420274ea8cb7c8/72127/Market%20news%2C%20week%201%2C%20September%202022.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5567a3fdfc8ce5b99c420274ea8cb7c8/8e2ef/Market%20news%2C%20week%201%2C%20September%202022.webp 320w,\n/static/5567a3fdfc8ce5b99c420274ea8cb7c8/0cc1c/Market%20news%2C%20week%201%2C%20September%202022.webp 640w,\n/static/5567a3fdfc8ce5b99c420274ea8cb7c8/7a708/Market%20news%2C%20week%201%2C%20September%202022.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"market-news-05-09-2022-11-09-2022","published_date":"2022-09-05","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"297","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Market news â€“ Week 1, September 2022","blog_description":"Last week, assets in various financial markets were hit, and some recovered part of their losses.

Despite sluggish growth, US macroeconomic indicators indicate economic progress is continuing, easing some of the Federal Reserve's burden. Even though the Fed acknowledged that its macroeconomic policy negatively affects household and business expenses, it reaffirmed its commitment to taming inflation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to EU policymakers, the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to tighten the monetary policy more aggressively, leading traders to increase the odds of an ECB rate hike to 75 basis points in September. This news led to a spike in government bond rates, while bond prices fell throughout Europe.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, on the GBP/USD front, the bleak UK economic picture continued to weigh on the native currency along with the escalating energy and cost-of-living crises.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, ECB officials will hold their monetary policy meeting, and traders will finally learn whether the ECB has leaned towards managing inflation or protecting fragile growth.

The yellow metal recovered most of its previous day's losses but replicated its lowest level in the last 2 months. The spot prices reached new daily highs on Friday to close the week above the $1,700 level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dollar-denominated commodity found some strength due to 2 factors. First, the US dollar dropped from a two-decade high ahead of the closely watched US jobs report. Second, the mild drop in US Treasury bond yields after the release of the non-farm payrolls report further helped support its growth.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold crossed just above its resistance level of $1,710 at the end of the week, making this price the new support level. With the next Fed Reserve's rate decision less than 3 weeks away, traders await the outcome as the US dollar will be impacted, exerting upward or downward pressure on gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, silver prices reversed from their lowest prices since July 2020 to reach $18.00 ahead of the US non-farm payroll results, snapping out of a five-day downtrend.

According to the British energy regulator, energy costs in the UK may increase by 80% to &pound;3,549 per year from the beginning of October, which is a concern that will contribute to the UK's economic downturn.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week, the focus will be on the non-farm payroll figures, which are critical to the September Fed rate hike decision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e00387b2-4527-43f3-ac50-2d59cf721420\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e00387b2-4527-43f3-ac50-2d59cf721420?width=1733&amp;height=872\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

However, the yellow metal suffered losses as a result of the second quarter GDP declining less than expected and traders shifting to stocks instead of safe havens such as gold.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, the rise in yellow metal prices was restrained by the rise in sovereign bond yields and after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned that rate increases would continue over the following months.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, oil rallied this week mainly due to Saudi Arabia's warning about supply limitations. Prices have risen since Saudi Arabia's oil minister suggested reducing production by the OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus). Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the US central bank is likely to continue raising interest rates to battle inflation. Energy consumption is often viewed negatively when rates are higher.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week's main focus will be on the non-farm payroll and unemployment rate statistics, which traders will closely follow to gauge the US economy.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/6869d17b-ba43-44c1-a2db-4a0a2e36711f?width=1733&amp;height=873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/6869d17b-ba43-44c1-a2db-4a0a2e36711f?width=1733&amp;height=873\" alt=\"Bitcoin Chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

Following a period of stabilisation, the market suffered a substantial drop, much to traders' surprise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin was trading at around the mid-$21,000 level for most of the week. However, over the weekend, Bitcoin was at the forefront of all the occurrences as the coin plummeted below the $20,000 mark for the first time since mid-July. This significant drop may have occurred due to concerns about the Fed's rate-hike path post the Jackson Hole speech. &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Earlier this month, the $20,000 level acted as a support level for Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency even went on to surpass the $25,000 mark. However, at the time of writing, Bitcoin dropped below that support level and is trading at $19,992.04.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other major cryptocurrencies followed Bitcoin's footsteps as the market experienced a wider retreat. Ethereum dropped below the $1,435 mark &ndash; its lowest since the last week of July.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin fell to $0.06, Cardano to $0.42, and Solana to $30.15, each getting a taste of the bearish movement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US stock markets</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial Avg (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>32,283.40</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-1,423.34</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-4.22%</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>12,605.17</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-637.73</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-4.82%</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>4,057.66</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-170.82</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-4.04%</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change and net change (%) are based on the weekly closing price change from Friday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the second week in a row, the major averages declined.

Often, a keylogger tool is used by scammers to capture the keystrokes &ndash; either using a programme (software) or a physical device (hardware) &ndash; and the data collected would be used for illegal activities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of keyloggers</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Software keyloggers</strong><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are apps and computer programmes that are secretly installed onto your device by a hacker through phishing attacks or remote downloading. In addition to tracking keyboard activity, some software keyloggers can also capture screenshots and information copied to your clipboard. These keyloggers can be detected and removed by antivirus software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of software keyloggers:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/79d37006-46b3-4ec8-b33d-4175e799d7c2?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/79d37006-46b3-4ec8-b33d-4175e799d7c2?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" alt=\"Types of software keyloggers or keylogging programmes.\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><strong>Hardware keyloggers</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are usually hidden in plain sight as they are built into or connected to your device.

Public WiFis are susceptible to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MitM attacks happen when a malicious third party pretends to be a legitimate middleman and intercepts communications between two parties. When a user decides to browse a certain website, the third party would interfere and send the user to a fraudulent site instead.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of MitM attacks:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/66bfdbd7-c4f9-4b34-853e-ab8222eeaf50?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/66bfdbd7-c4f9-4b34-853e-ab8222eeaf50?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" alt=\"The different types of MitM attacks that could affect your online trading account.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scareware</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As implied by its name, scareware is malware that intends to scare users.

If you have, a scammer may have attempted to bait you. Scammers who use this method of social engineering depend on feelings of curiosity or greed to trick users.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5b388e4e-93c3-45a0-8e5d-79d4bb766713?width=1280&amp;height=820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5b388e4e-93c3-45a0-8e5d-79d4bb766713?width=1280&amp;height=820\" alt=\"A baiting email that may redirect you to a malicious website or download malware to your device if you click on the links.\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be wary of random or unfamiliar websites offering free downloads of ebooks, music or movies, which only require you to create an account. The details you share are exactly what scammers want. The files you download could also contain malware that collects personal information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baiting can also happen in physical form. If you see a USB device or an external hard drive unattended somewhere, ignore it. Scammers leave infected devices lying around as bait to corrupt the devices they are plugged into.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 tips to secure your Deriv account&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with various social engineering attacks, here are some helpful suggestions to protect your Deriv account from hackers.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1. Don&rsquo;t click on random links</strong>.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure that the URL begins with <strong>HTTPS</strong> and not HTTP, and always pay attention to the spelling, characters, and other irregularities that can be found in the URL. If you find that our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official website</a> doesn&rsquo;t begin with HTTPS, or that Deriv is spelt incorrectly, don&rsquo;t enter your personal information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you receive an email from a familiar organisation requesting you to confirm your login details on another website, try accessing the website without clicking on the link provided. Don&rsquo;t click on links that redirect you to an external website.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>2. Double-check message contents. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly examine the emails and messages you receive to confirm if the tone and content match those of the sender. Additionally, observe whether there are spelling and grammatical errors in the message. Most legitimate businesses carefully craft their messages before sending them to you (yes, that includes us!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice something fishy? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copy the content of the email and look it up on a search engine to check if it&rsquo;s a popular phishing scam, or get in touch with the sender through a phone call or alternate email address. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv will only contact you through <a href=\"mailto:no-reply@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no-reply@deriv.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">support@deriv.com</a>. So if you receive an email from us which did not come from these email addresses, contact us via <a href=\"https://deriv.com/contact_us/?is_livechat_open=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat</a> and report the email.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3. Shield yourself. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your operating systems and antivirus software are regularly updated. Our website and apps are constantly upgrading and improving, so keep your device up-to-date and consistently update your apps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also recommend using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection when trading with us, especially if you&rsquo;re accessing sensitive information.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>4. Turn off auto-connect settings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can avoid MitM attacks by ensuring your devices don&rsquo;t automatically connect to WiFi and Bluetooth networks. Better yet, turn your network settings off unless you need to use them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discourage connecting to public WiFi as hackers could create fake WiFi networks with names of legitimate individuals or businesses nearby. To ensure you are connecting to a real, secure, and reliable public WiFi network, double-check the WiFi credentials.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5. Set a strong password. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your password should be unique, containing a mixture of numbers, symbols, and uppercase and lowercase letters. Exclude personal information such as your name or birthdate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change your password regularly and try not to use the same password for multiple accounts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Password managers can help store your passwords and recommend stronger passwords. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, enable 2FA using your mobile device or email. Accounts that require a password and 2FA tend to be more secure than those only requiring passwords.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6. Be aware of your surroundings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never leave your belongings unattended.

A stock index usually consists of a set number of the top stocks of a particular exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a trader, understanding how to measure stock market indices is important as it helps you assess the performance of a particular stock market, and through that, you can predict the pattern of stock market prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note the change in value over time&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common way to read an index is to note the changes in its values over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, the value of a stock market index is based on the value of the individual stocks that make up that index. Because these prices change often, each stock market index is unique and no two are completely alike.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With different stocks and varying calculations, it is worth noting that every new stock market index has different starting values, and should not be measured against each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it in perspective, if one index goes up 300 points a day while the other goes up only 50, you may think that the first index performed better than the second. However, if the first index was initially 50,000 while the second index started at 500, then the second index had done better in terms of percentage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With stock market indices, you should focus on the percentage of rise and fall instead of its point value, as a higher percentage gain means a bigger profit, while a higher percentage loss signifies a bigger loss.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that most stock market indices do not measure the performance of the entire market but only show the general health of the sector, industry or economy they represent. Therefore, you can find out how each stock contributes to the index by understanding which stocks make up that particular index and how they are weighted.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the weightage of the indices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To recap, there are three types of weighted indices, which are market-capitalisation-weighted, equal-weighted, and price-weighted indices. They are categorised according to how the stocks influence the overall market index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To properly read stock market indices, you&rsquo;d need to know how much weight each individual stock would have on the index. There are separate ways of reading and analysing different weighted indices. This part will explore how each weighted index could be read.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being the most common index weighting, market-capitalisation-weighted indices consider stocks with a larger market capitalisation to have more influence and a bigger weightage on the overall market index. These indices represent what a trader would earn if they purchased stocks of every company in the index.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s look at an example index that consists of Company A, Company B, and Company C. Let&rsquo;s say these companies have 7,500, 2,000, and 500 stocks respectively, each of their stocks priced at USD10, USD100, and USD500. In this example, Company A would have a lower market capitalisation at USD75,000, followed by Company B at USD200,000, leaving Company C with the highest market capitalisation at USD250,000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Company C&rsquo;s stocks rise, it would have more of an impact on the value and percentage of the index compared to Company A having the same rise in stock prices. In the same way, if Company C&rsquo;s stocks plummet, the value of this index will be more affected than if it were a huge decline in Company A&rsquo;s stocks.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices, as their name suggests, are affected equally by every company they consist of.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find the value of this index, each of these companies&rsquo; individual stocks would be multiplied by the weight each company carries (calculated according to the number of companies in the index), and summed up to get the index value.</span></p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 34.8192%;\">Equal-weighted index of Companies A, B, and C</td>\n<td style=\"width: 65.1808%;\">(USD 10 x 33.3%) + (USD 100 x 33.3%) + (USD 500 x 33.3%)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking back at the example above, there are 3 companies, which means each company would share one-third of the weight or 33.3% each. Following this formula, the index value would be USD203.13.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like market-capitalisation-weighted indices, the value of price-weighted indices depend on the price of each individual stock.

The price rises, however, are relentless. August's Core Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.6% (MoM), above forecasts. Other CPI measures also rose, resulting in expectations of a 100 basis points rate hike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EUR/USD fell and only made tiny recoveries in response to poor US data, such as disappointing retail sales estimates. In nominal terms, inflation is outpacing consumption.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With respect to the monetary policy, European Central Bank (ECB) officials overwhelmingly endorsed a substantial rate increase in October. This contrasts with ECB President Christine Lagarde's more nuanced stance following the recent rate decision.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the euro is fighting hard, the US dollar seems to be holding on tight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The GBP/USD failed to maintain its bounce, falling roughly by 200 pips. The pair finished the week in the negative, trading below $1.1500. The decline in the pair's prices could be due to disappointing retail sales in the UK. Sales volumes in the retail sector declined by 1.6% in August, continuing with the summer of 2021 trend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week will be important for the markets as the Fed and Bank of England decide on interest rate hikes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/991cfa90-ca1d-41a0-bcb9-e7c4f2e6d6ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/991cfa90-ca1d-41a0-bcb9-e7c4f2e6d6ab?width=2258&amp;height=1130\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Despite growing concerns that the US central bank's tightening might cause a recession, US economic statistics showed that consumer sentiment continued to improve, driving up this precious metal's price.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI prices hovered around $85 due to fears of a long-term decline in global energy demand. Because of the same reasons mentioned above, oil prices have fallen by around a quarter in the last 3 months.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund warned of an imminent global economic downturn in late 2022/23, weighing on morale.

Now, the financial markets are unpredictable, but you can try to avoid these (and several other) trading mistakes by following this 4-step plan of action. These steps aren&rsquo;t foolproof but are a good way to help you develop the habit of making more responsible trading decisions.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1 &ndash; Planning what trades to <strong><em>start </em></strong>and when</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to what most people think, placing a potentially successful trade has less to do with luck and more to do with planning your trades in a disciplined manner. Your prediction needs to be thought out and based on fact-based research that includes a survey of market conditions. <br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare a trading plan that includes analysing current <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/search/?category=market-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global and economic events</a> and do your research on how markets are responding to them. If you have limited time for research and analysis, use lesser capital to trade 1 or a maximum of 2 markets simultaneously. This trading plan will help you analyse trading opportunities practically and objectively while also discovering which asset is better suited for your risk appetite.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2 &ndash; Planning what trades to </span><strong><em>end </em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and when</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every trader thinks of when to start a trade. Very few know how to analyse when to end it. Traders land up suffering more losses on losing trades in the hope that the market will reverse and the loss will turn into profit. A </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/fundamental-analysis-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fundamental</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technical</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> exit strategy plan will help you avoid mistakes like emotional and impulsive trading or not cutting a losing trade. Key indicators like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/support-and-resistance-in-chart-patterns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resistance and support</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lines are a fact-based way to understand market sentiment. Information on resistance and support lines can also highlight the range of an asset's price movement.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When placing trades, use this information to identify the prices at which you will close the trades &ndash; either to secure your potential profit or to limit losses if the market reverses. But more importantly, avoid changing your plan so you can handle any trade objectively if it doesn't go as planned.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3 &ndash; Use risk-management features</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading is a high-risk activity, and the best way to deal with a high-risk situation is to have a safety net even if you&rsquo;re fully geared up. That safety net is using</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risk-management features</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to secure your potential gains and control your losses when the market moves against you. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suppose you&rsquo;re the type of trader who diversifies their portfolio with assets from different markets. In that case, you may not be able to monitor all assets&rsquo; price movements simultaneously and cut losses in time. In an instance like this, features like take profit and stop loss can help you secure your potential gains or cut losses before they become too much, especially when market conditions are volatile.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4 &ndash; Journal to learn about financial market trends and your trading style</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use a journal to document the events of your trading day. Note down which trades were profitable and which weren&rsquo;t. Add notes against each of them, mentioning what data you based your prediction on and any insights or past learnings that impacted your decision-making process. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from helping you stay objective, this journal will be useful in understanding how markets respond to various global and economic events and discover </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/top-4-trading-styles-choose-the-one-that-suits-you-best/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what kind of a trader you are</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Often, a keylogger tool is used by scammers to capture the keystrokes &ndash; either using a programme (software) or a physical device (hardware) &ndash; and the data collected would be used for illegal activities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of keyloggers</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Software keyloggers</strong><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are apps and computer programmes that are secretly installed onto your device by a hacker through phishing attacks or remote downloading. In addition to tracking keyboard activity, some software keyloggers can also capture screenshots and information copied to your clipboard. These keyloggers can be detected and removed by antivirus software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of software keyloggers:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/79d37006-46b3-4ec8-b33d-4175e799d7c2?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/79d37006-46b3-4ec8-b33d-4175e799d7c2?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" alt=\"Types of software keyloggers or keylogging programmes.\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><strong>Hardware keyloggers</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are usually hidden in plain sight as they are built into or connected to your device. Unlike software keyloggers, antivirus software would not be able to detect these keyloggers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of hardware keyloggers:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/12bed14f-8668-4ec1-8685-ddd108150074?width=2667&amp;height=1580\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/12bed14f-8668-4ec1-8685-ddd108150074?width=2667&amp;height=1580\" alt=\"Types of hardware keyloggers or keylogging devices.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Man-in-the-middle attack</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While having free public WiFi wherever you go does seem convenient, it comes with risks. Public WiFis are susceptible to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MitM attacks happen when a malicious third party pretends to be a legitimate middleman and intercepts communications between two parties. When a user decides to browse a certain website, the third party would interfere and send the user to a fraudulent site instead.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of MitM attacks:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/66bfdbd7-c4f9-4b34-853e-ab8222eeaf50?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/66bfdbd7-c4f9-4b34-853e-ab8222eeaf50?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" alt=\"The different types of MitM attacks that could affect your online trading account.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scareware</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As implied by its name, scareware is malware that intends to scare users. By creating fake warnings, scammers intimidate users into installing malicious software or visiting websites that will corrupt their devices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This message is an example of scareware:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4af74d15-283d-4582-93f2-9581ca507863?width=1280&amp;height=380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4af74d15-283d-4582-93f2-9581ca507863?width=1280&amp;height=380\" alt=\"An example of scareware claiming that a malware has been detected on your device.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baiting</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever received a random email for the delivery of an order you never made? If you have, a scammer may have attempted to bait you. Scammers who use this method of social engineering depend on feelings of curiosity or greed to trick users.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5b388e4e-93c3-45a0-8e5d-79d4bb766713?width=1280&amp;height=820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5b388e4e-93c3-45a0-8e5d-79d4bb766713?width=1280&amp;height=820\" alt=\"A baiting email that may redirect you to a malicious website or download malware to your device if you click on the links.\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be wary of random or unfamiliar websites offering free downloads of ebooks, music or movies, which only require you to create an account. The details you share are exactly what scammers want. The files you download could also contain malware that collects personal information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baiting can also happen in physical form. If you see a USB device or an external hard drive unattended somewhere, ignore it. Scammers leave infected devices lying around as bait to corrupt the devices they are plugged into.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 tips to secure your Deriv account&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with various social engineering attacks, here are some helpful suggestions to protect your Deriv account from hackers.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1. Don&rsquo;t click on random links</strong>.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure that the URL begins with <strong>HTTPS</strong> and not HTTP, and always pay attention to the spelling, characters, and other irregularities that can be found in the URL. If you find that our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official website</a> doesn&rsquo;t begin with HTTPS, or that Deriv is spelt incorrectly, don&rsquo;t enter your personal information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you receive an email from a familiar organisation requesting you to confirm your login details on another website, try accessing the website without clicking on the link provided. Don&rsquo;t click on links that redirect you to an external website.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>2. Double-check message contents. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly examine the emails and messages you receive to confirm if the tone and content match those of the sender. Additionally, observe whether there are spelling and grammatical errors in the message. Most legitimate businesses carefully craft their messages before sending them to you (yes, that includes us!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice something fishy? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copy the content of the email and look it up on a search engine to check if it&rsquo;s a popular phishing scam, or get in touch with the sender through a phone call or alternate email address. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv will only contact you through <a href=\"mailto:no-reply@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no-reply@deriv.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">support@deriv.com</a>. So if you receive an email from us which did not come from these email addresses, contact us via <a href=\"https://deriv.com/contact_us/?is_livechat_open=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat</a> and report the email.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3. Shield yourself. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your operating systems and antivirus software are regularly updated. Our website and apps are constantly upgrading and improving, so keep your device up-to-date and consistently update your apps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also recommend using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection when trading with us, especially if you&rsquo;re accessing sensitive information.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>4. Turn off auto-connect settings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can avoid MitM attacks by ensuring your devices don&rsquo;t automatically connect to WiFi and Bluetooth networks. Better yet, turn your network settings off unless you need to use them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discourage connecting to public WiFi as hackers could create fake WiFi networks with names of legitimate individuals or businesses nearby. To ensure you are connecting to a real, secure, and reliable public WiFi network, double-check the WiFi credentials.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5. Set a strong password. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your password should be unique, containing a mixture of numbers, symbols, and uppercase and lowercase letters. Exclude personal information such as your name or birthdate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change your password regularly and try not to use the same password for multiple accounts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Password managers can help store your passwords and recommend stronger passwords. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, enable 2FA using your mobile device or email. Accounts that require a password and 2FA tend to be more secure than those only requiring passwords.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6. Be aware of your surroundings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never leave your belongings unattended. To avoid keyloggers from being implanted or infecting your device, always ensure your gadgets are within view and look out for odd electronics that seem out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t let your curiosity get the best of you if you find stray USB devices or external hard drives. You don&rsquo;t want to invite malware into your device yourself, do you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t fall victim to social engineering!

Check out the benefits of forex trading and see why you should start trading the biggest financial market in the world too.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is not only the biggest financial market in the world, it is also one of the most accessible markets to trade on. This marketplace is made up of buyers and sellers from all over the world participating in </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-forex-live-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forex live trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and offers opportunities suitable for both beginner and experienced traders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;ve been thinking about whether to add forex to your trading portfolio, read on to find out why you should.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade 24/5&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is open round the clock on weekdays, giving you even more opportunities to trade international currency pairs and take advantage of their price movements. Thanks to the business hours of forex exchanges across international time zones, at least one region is operating at any point during the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four major exchanges around the world that start and end the trading day are Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York &mdash; with these exchanges, forex trading starts at 9:00 pm (GMT) on Sunday and ends at 9:00 pm (GMT) on Friday.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gain exposure to global economic markets&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade forex, you&rsquo;re able to gain international exposure to different global markets depending on the currency pair or basket you trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forex currency pairs are categorised into major, minor, and exotic pairs, and are made up of currencies from all over the world. These three categories have different liquidity levels that represent how actively traded the currency pairs are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also trade currency basket indices. These indices measure the value of one currency against a basket of five other equally weighted global currencies, increasing your exposure to even more global markets at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade a highly liquid market</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be bought and sold. When a market is highly liquid, it basically means that there are lots of buyers and sellers trading at any point, leading to a higher trading volume and lower transaction costs as traders seek to complete transactions easily and quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is one of the most liquid in the world, with over 6 trillion USD traded daily. With the large number of active trades happening every day and low costs, it becomes easier for traders to enter the forex market and start trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profit from both rising and falling prices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade forex via options, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFDs (contract for differences)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and multipliers, which all allow you to potentially profit from rising as well as falling prices. With these trade types, you&rsquo;ll be predicting the price movements of currency pairs or baskets, and if the price moves according to your prediction, you&rsquo;ll earn a profit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trades are timed, so you&rsquo;ll be predicting market movements within a specific time period. On the other hand, CFDs trades can stay open for as long as you want to take advantage of market movements (as long as you have sufficient funds in your account to cover potential losses in case the market moves against you). With multipliers, you&rsquo;ll get to multiply your potential profits without losing more than your stake.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start trading with low capital requirement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the highly liquid nature of the forex market and low transaction costs, you can open a forex trade even with relatively low capital. On Deriv, all you need is a 5 USD deposit into your account, and you can start trading forex on any of Deriv&rsquo;s platforms.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the most of high leverage</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade major, minor, and exotic currencies with high leverage. Trading with leverage gives you more market exposure by allowing you to trade more than your capital allows. This means that you get to open a trade that&rsquo;s worth more than your stake. For example, with a leverage of 1:10 and a stake amount of 100 USD, you&rsquo;ll get to open a trade that&rsquo;s actually worth 1,000 USD.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The profit or loss you make at the end of your trade is based on the trade&rsquo;s full value, so trading with leverage allows you to maximise your capital and increase your potential profits. However, do note that this also means that potential losses are also increased.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of tight spreads</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices, and represents the cost to open a CFD trade. These are determined by the broker and are calculated in pips, which are small price movements of an asset.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv offers one of the tightest competitive spreads in the industry, with spreads as low as 0.5 pips. In a highly liquid market like forex where there&rsquo;s a high trading volume and transactions are completed quickly, the tighter the spread, the faster you are likely to gain back your capital and take greater advantage from the price changes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- - -</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about options trading and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Deriv before you get started.

On Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms, you can also avoid increased losses when the market moves against you. In this blog post, we explain how the risk-management features on Deriv&rsquo;s platforms make them excellent choices for trading multipliers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4 ways Deriv gives you more control over your multipliers trade&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>Automatic stop out&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you trade with multipliers on Deriv, you can never lose more than your stake. With an automatic stop out feature, your positions are automatically closed as soon as your losses are equal to your stake amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take profit</h3>\n<p>Usually, you will need to close your position manually to secure your profit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The take profit feature allows you to automate this process. All you have to do is set a level of profit you&rsquo;d be satisfied with. If your profit reaches or exceeds this amount, your position will be closed and your profit will be added to your account balance.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stop loss</h3>\n<p>Stop loss lets you set exactly how much you are willing to risk. You can cut your losses before you lose your entire stake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever your loss equals or exceeds your stop loss amount, your trade will be closed automatically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you open a trade with a 10 USD stake. The automatic stop out will close your trade when your losses reach 10 USD. However, if you want to minimise losses even further, you can set a stop loss level of 5 USD.

Based on the ebook â€˜7 traits of successful financial tradersâ€™.","blog_post":"<p>Every trader goes through their own trading journey, some admittedly more successful than others. Based on the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>' by veteran trader and self-made millionaire Vince Stanzione, we go through how successful traders plan their trading strategy and what you can learn from their examples.</p>\n<h2>They cut their losses and let winning trades run</h2>\n<p>Trading comes down to psychology &mdash; everyone wants to win; no one wants to lose.</p>\n<p>When faced with an unprofitable trade, experienced traders don&rsquo;t let it run and hope things will get better. They know it&rsquo;s a bad idea to keep an unprofitable trade open and let it accumulate losses, which will also make it harder to gain any profit. They know when to cut their losses.</p>\n<p>The following table explains why cutting your losses is crucial. It shows the returns needed to break even for unprofitable trades. For example, if your trade has already lost 5%, you&rsquo;ll need the position to move in your favour by 5.3% to break even.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" alt=\"Returns Needed to Break Even\" width=\"438\" height=\"331\" /></a><br /><br /></strong></p>\n<h2>They plan their exit strategy</h2>\n<p>Inexperienced traders tend to focus on when to open a trade, but pay little attention to closing it. According to Vince Stanzione, deciding when to exit a trade is even more critical than deciding when to enter it.</p>\n<p>Your exit rule to take a profit or loss should be determined before you start trading, and you should stick to it. It shouldn&rsquo;t be some afterthought that you consider while your trade is running. Once you open a trade, your psychological responses can change, and your emotions can influence your decisions. So, it&rsquo;s important to have an exit strategy and follow it.</p>\n<h2>They diversify</h2>\n<p>It may seem like a common trading tip you often hear &mdash; diversify your portfolio. While you should diversify by trading on a variety of markets and assets, you can also add diversity to your strategy by trading on the different directions of price movements to lessen your risk.</p>\n<p>With the availability of digital options and contracts for difference (CFDs), you can trade on markets that go up, down, and even sideways. You don&rsquo;t need to only trade on markets or assets that are only moving in one direction.</p>\n<h2>They let trends be their friends</h2>\n<p>Experienced traders follow trends and profit from them. Trends can be up or down, but overall traders gain more from an uptrend because a market can go up by an unlimited amount, whereas the most a market can go down is 100%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his ebook, Vince Stanzione says that successful traders trade according to what they see, not what they think is going to happen. They depend on the numbers to tell them what is happening &mdash; if the price of an asset rises from 60 to 65 to 70, it is going up &mdash; &nbsp;and they trade accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They are masters of their emotions</h2>\n<p>After facing a few losses, new traders may doubt their trading strategy and start thinking about changing their approach. But if you keep changing your strategy, how will you know if it works?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Markets don&rsquo;t usually perform as we would like them to. Plus, many external factors can affect your emotions and trading judgment. This is why you need to learn to recognise when you are getting emotional about your trades &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s feeling unsure about your strategy or an attachment to your positions. Remember to follow your trading strategy, and don&rsquo;t trade emotionally.</p>\n<h2>They keep it simple</h2>\n<p>Many new traders think they need lots of fancy software, multiple trading screens, and a super-fast internet connection to trade successfully. But the truth is, while they may be helpful, these tools won&rsquo;t help you financially succeed as a trader.</p>\n<p>Keep things simple. Deriv gives traders access to a variety of trading platforms and various financial markets. Sure, you can check out extra trading plugins or systems for some extra help if you&rsquo;re a new trader, but you don&rsquo;t need to spend thousands of dollars on fancy software to become a successful trader.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They know what they can control</h2>\n<p>However smart we think we are when it comes to trading, we are dealing with unpredictable elements when we trade. What we know and what we can control should help us decide how much we can risk. Determining these is what you should be spending time on.</p>\n<p>For example, how much risk you can allow yourself to have per trade. This is something you can control even though market prices fluctuate or an asset doesn&rsquo;t perform as you had predicted. Build a plan to manage your trade finances, and follow through with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Download the full version of the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>', by Vince Stanzione, veteran trader and self-made millionaire.

These three categories have different liquidity levels that represent how actively traded the currency pairs are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also trade currency basket indices. These indices measure the value of one currency against a basket of five other equally weighted global currencies, increasing your exposure to even more global markets at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade a highly liquid market</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be bought and sold. When a market is highly liquid, it basically means that there are lots of buyers and sellers trading at any point, leading to a higher trading volume and lower transaction costs as traders seek to complete transactions easily and quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is one of the most liquid in the world, with over 6 trillion USD traded daily. With the large number of active trades happening every day and low costs, it becomes easier for traders to enter the forex market and start trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profit from both rising and falling prices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade forex via options, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFDs (contract for differences)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and multipliers, which all allow you to potentially profit from rising as well as falling prices. With these trade types, you&rsquo;ll be predicting the price movements of currency pairs or baskets, and if the price moves according to your prediction, you&rsquo;ll earn a profit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trades are timed, so you&rsquo;ll be predicting market movements within a specific time period. On the other hand, CFDs trades can stay open for as long as you want to take advantage of market movements (as long as you have sufficient funds in your account to cover potential losses in case the market moves against you). With multipliers, you&rsquo;ll get to multiply your potential profits without losing more than your stake.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start trading with low capital requirement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the highly liquid nature of the forex market and low transaction costs, you can open a forex trade even with relatively low capital. On Deriv, all you need is a 5 USD deposit into your account, and you can start trading forex on any of Deriv&rsquo;s platforms.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the most of high leverage</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade major, minor, and exotic currencies with high leverage. Trading with leverage gives you more market exposure by allowing you to trade more than your capital allows. This means that you get to open a trade that&rsquo;s worth more than your stake. For example, with a leverage of 1:10 and a stake amount of 100 USD, you&rsquo;ll get to open a trade that&rsquo;s actually worth 1,000 USD.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The profit or loss you make at the end of your trade is based on the trade&rsquo;s full value, so trading with leverage allows you to maximise your capital and increase your potential profits. However, do note that this also means that potential losses are also increased.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of tight spreads</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices, and represents the cost to open a CFD trade. These are determined by the broker and are calculated in pips, which are small price movements of an asset.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv offers one of the tightest competitive spreads in the industry, with spreads as low as 0.5 pips. In a highly liquid market like forex where there&rsquo;s a high trading volume and transactions are completed quickly, the tighter the spread, the faster you are likely to gain back your capital and take greater advantage from the price changes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- - -</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about options trading and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Deriv before you get started.

On Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms, you can also avoid increased losses when the market moves against you. In this blog post, we explain how the risk-management features on Deriv&rsquo;s platforms make them excellent choices for trading multipliers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4 ways Deriv gives you more control over your multipliers trade&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>Automatic stop out&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you trade with multipliers on Deriv, you can never lose more than your stake. With an automatic stop out feature, your positions are automatically closed as soon as your losses are equal to your stake amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take profit</h3>\n<p>Usually, you will need to close your position manually to secure your profit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The take profit feature allows you to automate this process. All you have to do is set a level of profit you&rsquo;d be satisfied with. If your profit reaches or exceeds this amount, your position will be closed and your profit will be added to your account balance.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stop loss</h3>\n<p>Stop loss lets you set exactly how much you are willing to risk. You can cut your losses before you lose your entire stake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever your loss equals or exceeds your stop loss amount, your trade will be closed automatically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you open a trade with a 10 USD stake. The automatic stop out will close your trade when your losses reach 10 USD. However, if you want to minimise losses even further, you can set a stop loss level of 5 USD. When your loss reaches this amount, your trade will automatically close.</p>\n<h3>Deal cancellation</h3>\n<p>Opened a trade, but having second thoughts? With deal cancellation, you have the option to cancel a trade within a selected time period (depending on the market and asset you&rsquo;re trading) after opening it and reclaim your stake. Please note that Deriv charges a small fee for this service.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>With these 4 risk-management features, trading multipliers on Deriv can help you avoid missing out on opportunities and prevent you from losing more than you're willing to lose. <a href=\"https://oauth.deriv.com/oauth2/authorize?app_id=16929&amp;l=en&amp;brand=deriv&amp;date_first_contact=2021-06-07&amp;signup_device=desktop&amp;utm_source=deriv_direct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Log in</a> or <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sign up for a free demo account</a> to give Deriv multipliers a try.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>The deal cancellation feature is not available on multipliers on cryptocurrencies for users residing within the EU.</em></p>"},{"id":"71eb0c26-c21b-45b3-9a95-40c9b3408ce3","main_image":{"id":"fd9ee8a0-0eec-49cc-be9a-1eca308741e7","description":"Tips and tricks of the online trading on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/72127/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/05ada/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 320w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/4eab0/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 640w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/72127/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/8e2ef/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 320w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/0cc1c/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 640w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/7a708/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"useful-tips-on-how-to-trade-online","published_date":"2022-07-07","featured":true,"tags":[{"id":"174","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"Useful tips on how to trade online","blog_description":"We outline useful tips on how to trade online by looking at how experienced traders trade. Based on the ebook â€˜7 traits of successful financial tradersâ€™.","blog_post":"<p>Every trader goes through their own trading journey, some admittedly more successful than others. Based on the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>' by veteran trader and self-made millionaire Vince Stanzione, we go through how successful traders plan their trading strategy and what you can learn from their examples.</p>\n<h2>They cut their losses and let winning trades run</h2>\n<p>Trading comes down to psychology &mdash; everyone wants to win; no one wants to lose.</p>\n<p>When faced with an unprofitable trade, experienced traders don&rsquo;t let it run and hope things will get better. They know it&rsquo;s a bad idea to keep an unprofitable trade open and let it accumulate losses, which will also make it harder to gain any profit. They know when to cut their losses.</p>\n<p>The following table explains why cutting your losses is crucial. It shows the returns needed to break even for unprofitable trades. For example, if your trade has already lost 5%, you&rsquo;ll need the position to move in your favour by 5.3% to break even.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" alt=\"Returns Needed to Break Even\" width=\"438\" height=\"331\" /></a><br /><br /></strong></p>\n<h2>They plan their exit strategy</h2>\n<p>Inexperienced traders tend to focus on when to open a trade, but pay little attention to closing it. According to Vince Stanzione, deciding when to exit a trade is even more critical than deciding when to enter it.</p>\n<p>Your exit rule to take a profit or loss should be determined before you start trading, and you should stick to it. It shouldn&rsquo;t be some afterthought that you consider while your trade is running. Once you open a trade, your psychological responses can change, and your emotions can influence your decisions. So, it&rsquo;s important to have an exit strategy and follow it.</p>\n<h2>They diversify</h2>\n<p>It may seem like a common trading tip you often hear &mdash; diversify your portfolio. While you should diversify by trading on a variety of markets and assets, you can also add diversity to your strategy by trading on the different directions of price movements to lessen your risk.</p>\n<p>With the availability of digital options and contracts for difference (CFDs), you can trade on markets that go up, down, and even sideways. You don&rsquo;t need to only trade on markets or assets that are only moving in one direction.</p>\n<h2>They let trends be their friends</h2>\n<p>Experienced traders follow trends and profit from them. Trends can be up or down, but overall traders gain more from an uptrend because a market can go up by an unlimited amount, whereas the most a market can go down is 100%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his ebook, Vince Stanzione says that successful traders trade according to what they see, not what they think is going to happen. They depend on the numbers to tell them what is happening &mdash; if the price of an asset rises from 60 to 65 to 70, it is going up &mdash; &nbsp;and they trade accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They are masters of their emotions</h2>\n<p>After facing a few losses, new traders may doubt their trading strategy and start thinking about changing their approach. But if you keep changing your strategy, how will you know if it works?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Markets don&rsquo;t usually perform as we would like them to. Plus, many external factors can affect your emotions and trading judgment. This is why you need to learn to recognise when you are getting emotional about your trades &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s feeling unsure about your strategy or an attachment to your positions. Remember to follow your trading strategy, and don&rsquo;t trade emotionally.</p>\n<h2>They keep it simple</h2>\n<p>Many new traders think they need lots of fancy software, multiple trading screens, and a super-fast internet connection to trade successfully. But the truth is, while they may be helpful, these tools won&rsquo;t help you financially succeed as a trader.</p>\n<p>Keep things simple. Deriv gives traders access to a variety of trading platforms and various financial markets. Sure, you can check out extra trading plugins or systems for some extra help if you&rsquo;re a new trader, but you don&rsquo;t need to spend thousands of dollars on fancy software to become a successful trader.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They know what they can control</h2>\n<p>However smart we think we are when it comes to trading, we are dealing with unpredictable elements when we trade. What we know and what we can control should help us decide how much we can risk. Determining these is what you should be spending time on.</p>\n<p>For example, how much risk you can allow yourself to have per trade. This is something you can control even though market prices fluctuate or an asset doesn&rsquo;t perform as you had predicted. Build a plan to manage your trade finances, and follow through with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Download the full version of the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>', by Vince Stanzione, veteran trader and self-made millionaire.

In a highly liquid market like forex where there&rsquo;s a high trading volume and transactions are completed quickly, the tighter the spread, the faster you are likely to gain back your capital and take greater advantage from the price changes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- - -</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about options trading and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Deriv before you get started.

On Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms, you can also avoid increased losses when the market moves against you. In this blog post, we explain how the risk-management features on Deriv&rsquo;s platforms make them excellent choices for trading multipliers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4 ways Deriv gives you more control over your multipliers trade&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>Automatic stop out&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you trade with multipliers on Deriv, you can never lose more than your stake. With an automatic stop out feature, your positions are automatically closed as soon as your losses are equal to your stake amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take profit</h3>\n<p>Usually, you will need to close your position manually to secure your profit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The take profit feature allows you to automate this process. All you have to do is set a level of profit you&rsquo;d be satisfied with. If your profit reaches or exceeds this amount, your position will be closed and your profit will be added to your account balance.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stop loss</h3>\n<p>Stop loss lets you set exactly how much you are willing to risk. You can cut your losses before you lose your entire stake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever your loss equals or exceeds your stop loss amount, your trade will be closed automatically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you open a trade with a 10 USD stake. The automatic stop out will close your trade when your losses reach 10 USD. However, if you want to minimise losses even further, you can set a stop loss level of 5 USD. When your loss reaches this amount, your trade will automatically close.</p>\n<h3>Deal cancellation</h3>\n<p>Opened a trade, but having second thoughts? With deal cancellation, you have the option to cancel a trade within a selected time period (depending on the market and asset you&rsquo;re trading) after opening it and reclaim your stake. Please note that Deriv charges a small fee for this service.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>With these 4 risk-management features, trading multipliers on Deriv can help you avoid missing out on opportunities and prevent you from losing more than you're willing to lose. <a href=\"https://oauth.deriv.com/oauth2/authorize?app_id=16929&amp;l=en&amp;brand=deriv&amp;date_first_contact=2021-06-07&amp;signup_device=desktop&amp;utm_source=deriv_direct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Log in</a> or <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sign up for a free demo account</a> to give Deriv multipliers a try.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>The deal cancellation feature is not available on multipliers on cryptocurrencies for users residing within the EU.</em></p>"},{"id":"71eb0c26-c21b-45b3-9a95-40c9b3408ce3","main_image":{"id":"fd9ee8a0-0eec-49cc-be9a-1eca308741e7","description":"Tips and tricks of the online trading on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/72127/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/05ada/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 320w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/4eab0/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 640w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/72127/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/8e2ef/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 320w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/0cc1c/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 640w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/7a708/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"useful-tips-on-how-to-trade-online","published_date":"2022-07-07","featured":true,"tags":[{"id":"174","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"Useful tips on how to trade online","blog_description":"We outline useful tips on how to trade online by looking at how experienced traders trade. Based on the ebook â€˜7 traits of successful financial tradersâ€™.","blog_post":"<p>Every trader goes through their own trading journey, some admittedly more successful than others. Based on the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>' by veteran trader and self-made millionaire Vince Stanzione, we go through how successful traders plan their trading strategy and what you can learn from their examples.</p>\n<h2>They cut their losses and let winning trades run</h2>\n<p>Trading comes down to psychology &mdash; everyone wants to win; no one wants to lose.</p>\n<p>When faced with an unprofitable trade, experienced traders don&rsquo;t let it run and hope things will get better. They know it&rsquo;s a bad idea to keep an unprofitable trade open and let it accumulate losses, which will also make it harder to gain any profit. They know when to cut their losses.</p>\n<p>The following table explains why cutting your losses is crucial. It shows the returns needed to break even for unprofitable trades. For example, if your trade has already lost 5%, you&rsquo;ll need the position to move in your favour by 5.3% to break even.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" alt=\"Returns Needed to Break Even\" width=\"438\" height=\"331\" /></a><br /><br /></strong></p>\n<h2>They plan their exit strategy</h2>\n<p>Inexperienced traders tend to focus on when to open a trade, but pay little attention to closing it. According to Vince Stanzione, deciding when to exit a trade is even more critical than deciding when to enter it.</p>\n<p>Your exit rule to take a profit or loss should be determined before you start trading, and you should stick to it. It shouldn&rsquo;t be some afterthought that you consider while your trade is running. Once you open a trade, your psychological responses can change, and your emotions can influence your decisions. So, it&rsquo;s important to have an exit strategy and follow it.</p>\n<h2>They diversify</h2>\n<p>It may seem like a common trading tip you often hear &mdash; diversify your portfolio. While you should diversify by trading on a variety of markets and assets, you can also add diversity to your strategy by trading on the different directions of price movements to lessen your risk.</p>\n<p>With the availability of digital options and contracts for difference (CFDs), you can trade on markets that go up, down, and even sideways. You don&rsquo;t need to only trade on markets or assets that are only moving in one direction.</p>\n<h2>They let trends be their friends</h2>\n<p>Experienced traders follow trends and profit from them. Trends can be up or down, but overall traders gain more from an uptrend because a market can go up by an unlimited amount, whereas the most a market can go down is 100%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his ebook, Vince Stanzione says that successful traders trade according to what they see, not what they think is going to happen. They depend on the numbers to tell them what is happening &mdash; if the price of an asset rises from 60 to 65 to 70, it is going up &mdash; &nbsp;and they trade accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They are masters of their emotions</h2>\n<p>After facing a few losses, new traders may doubt their trading strategy and start thinking about changing their approach. But if you keep changing your strategy, how will you know if it works?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Markets don&rsquo;t usually perform as we would like them to. Plus, many external factors can affect your emotions and trading judgment. This is why you need to learn to recognise when you are getting emotional about your trades &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s feeling unsure about your strategy or an attachment to your positions. Remember to follow your trading strategy, and don&rsquo;t trade emotionally.</p>\n<h2>They keep it simple</h2>\n<p>Many new traders think they need lots of fancy software, multiple trading screens, and a super-fast internet connection to trade successfully. But the truth is, while they may be helpful, these tools won&rsquo;t help you financially succeed as a trader.</p>\n<p>Keep things simple. Deriv gives traders access to a variety of trading platforms and various financial markets. Sure, you can check out extra trading plugins or systems for some extra help if you&rsquo;re a new trader, but you don&rsquo;t need to spend thousands of dollars on fancy software to become a successful trader.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They know what they can control</h2>\n<p>However smart we think we are when it comes to trading, we are dealing with unpredictable elements when we trade. What we know and what we can control should help us decide how much we can risk. Determining these is what you should be spending time on.</p>\n<p>For example, how much risk you can allow yourself to have per trade. This is something you can control even though market prices fluctuate or an asset doesn&rsquo;t perform as you had predicted. Build a plan to manage your trade finances, and follow through with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Download the full version of the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>', by Vince Stanzione, veteran trader and self-made millionaire.
