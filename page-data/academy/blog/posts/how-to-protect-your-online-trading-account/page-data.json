According to </span><a href=\"https://legaljobs.io/blog/cyber-crime-statistics/#:~:text=Hackers%20attack%20people%20worldwide%20roughly,according%20to%20internet%20security%20statistics.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cybercrime statistics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an average of 2,244 cybercrimes happen daily.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers and scammers use social engineering to manipulate and exploit the emotions of unsuspecting victims into sharing confidential data about themselves. These data breaches could cause significant losses to the victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog post, we will explain the different types of social engineering and how to protect yourself against them.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phishing is an attack where scammers pose as legitimate individuals or businesses to collect personal information from unsuspecting users.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users usually receive genuine-looking emails that lead them to a fake website, where they are tricked into revealing sensitive information such as their passwords or bank details.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are the various types of phishing:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a6f8ef91-423a-46f5-b4f3-73f59276f8d6?width=2667&amp;height=3677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a6f8ef91-423a-46f5-b4f3-73f59276f8d6?width=2667&amp;height=3677\" alt=\"Types of phishing that could affect your online trading account.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keylogging</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keystroke logging or keylogging is the act of secretly recording keystrokes on a keyboard. Often, a keylogger tool is used by scammers to capture the keystrokes &ndash; either using a programme (software) or a physical device (hardware) &ndash; and the data collected would be used for illegal activities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of keyloggers</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Software keyloggers</strong><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are apps and computer programmes that are secretly installed onto your device by a hacker through phishing attacks or remote downloading. In addition to tracking keyboard activity, some software keyloggers can also capture screenshots and information copied to your clipboard. These keyloggers can be detected and removed by antivirus software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of software keyloggers:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/79d37006-46b3-4ec8-b33d-4175e799d7c2?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/79d37006-46b3-4ec8-b33d-4175e799d7c2?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" alt=\"Types of software keyloggers or keylogging programmes.\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><strong>Hardware keyloggers</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are usually hidden in plain sight as they are built into or connected to your device. Unlike software keyloggers, antivirus software would not be able to detect these keyloggers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of hardware keyloggers:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/12bed14f-8668-4ec1-8685-ddd108150074?width=2667&amp;height=1580\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/12bed14f-8668-4ec1-8685-ddd108150074?width=2667&amp;height=1580\" alt=\"Types of hardware keyloggers or keylogging devices.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Man-in-the-middle attack</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While having free public WiFi wherever you go does seem convenient, it comes with risks. Public WiFis are susceptible to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MitM attacks happen when a malicious third party pretends to be a legitimate middleman and intercepts communications between two parties. When a user decides to browse a certain website, the third party would interfere and send the user to a fraudulent site instead.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few examples of MitM attacks:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/66bfdbd7-c4f9-4b34-853e-ab8222eeaf50?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/66bfdbd7-c4f9-4b34-853e-ab8222eeaf50?width=2667&amp;height=1457\" alt=\"The different types of MitM attacks that could affect your online trading account.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scareware</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As implied by its name, scareware is malware that intends to scare users. By creating fake warnings, scammers intimidate users into installing malicious software or visiting websites that will corrupt their devices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This message is an example of scareware:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4af74d15-283d-4582-93f2-9581ca507863?width=1280&amp;height=380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4af74d15-283d-4582-93f2-9581ca507863?width=1280&amp;height=380\" alt=\"An example of scareware claiming that a malware has been detected on your device.\" /></a></span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baiting</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever received a random email for the delivery of an order you never made? If you have, a scammer may have attempted to bait you. Scammers who use this method of social engineering depend on feelings of curiosity or greed to trick users.&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5b388e4e-93c3-45a0-8e5d-79d4bb766713?width=1280&amp;height=820\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5b388e4e-93c3-45a0-8e5d-79d4bb766713?width=1280&amp;height=820\" alt=\"A baiting email that may redirect you to a malicious website or download malware to your device if you click on the links.\" /></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be wary of random or unfamiliar websites offering free downloads of ebooks, music or movies, which only require you to create an account. The details you share are exactly what scammers want. The files you download could also contain malware that collects personal information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baiting can also happen in physical form. If you see a USB device or an external hard drive unattended somewhere, ignore it. Scammers leave infected devices lying around as bait to corrupt the devices they are plugged into.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 tips to secure your Deriv account&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re familiar with various social engineering attacks, here are some helpful suggestions to protect your Deriv account from hackers.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>1. Don&rsquo;t click on random links</strong>.</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure that the URL begins with <strong>HTTPS</strong> and not HTTP, and always pay attention to the spelling, characters, and other irregularities that can be found in the URL. If you find that our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official website</a> doesn&rsquo;t begin with HTTPS, or that Deriv is spelt incorrectly, don&rsquo;t enter your personal information. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you receive an email from a familiar organisation requesting you to confirm your login details on another website, try accessing the website without clicking on the link provided. Don&rsquo;t click on links that redirect you to an external website.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>2. Double-check message contents. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly examine the emails and messages you receive to confirm if the tone and content match those of the sender. Additionally, observe whether there are spelling and grammatical errors in the message. Most legitimate businesses carefully craft their messages before sending them to you (yes, that includes us!). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice something fishy? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copy the content of the email and look it up on a search engine to check if it&rsquo;s a popular phishing scam, or get in touch with the sender through a phone call or alternate email address. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv will only contact you through <a href=\"mailto:no-reply@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no-reply@deriv.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">support@deriv.com</a>. So if you receive an email from us which did not come from these email addresses, contact us via <a href=\"https://deriv.com/contact_us/?is_livechat_open=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">live chat</a> and report the email.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3. Shield yourself. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure your operating systems and antivirus software are regularly updated. Our website and apps are constantly upgrading and improving, so keep your device up-to-date and consistently update your apps. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also recommend using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection when trading with us, especially if you&rsquo;re accessing sensitive information.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>4. Turn off auto-connect settings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can avoid MitM attacks by ensuring your devices don&rsquo;t automatically connect to WiFi and Bluetooth networks. Better yet, turn your network settings off unless you need to use them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discourage connecting to public WiFi as hackers could create fake WiFi networks with names of legitimate individuals or businesses nearby. To ensure you are connecting to a real, secure, and reliable public WiFi network, double-check the WiFi credentials.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5. Set a strong password. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your password should be unique, containing a mixture of numbers, symbols, and uppercase and lowercase letters. Exclude personal information such as your name or birthdate. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change your password regularly and try not to use the same password for multiple accounts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Password managers can help store your passwords and recommend stronger passwords. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, enable 2FA using your mobile device or email. Accounts that require a password and 2FA tend to be more secure than those only requiring passwords.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6. Be aware of your surroundings. </strong></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never leave your belongings unattended. To avoid keyloggers from being implanted or infecting your device, always ensure your gadgets are within view and look out for odd electronics that seem out of place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t let your curiosity get the best of you if you find stray USB devices or external hard drives. You don&rsquo;t want to invite malware into your device yourself, do you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;t fall victim to social engineering! Make sure your <a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv account</a> is secure by following these tips.</span></p>","author":{"id":"0d7772f6-5338-488f-a8aa-adfb6c5074b9","name":"The Deriv team","image":{"id":"9826d676-357b-4683-8f80-28a4ef931f91","description":"Deriv
