On Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms, you can also avoid increased losses when the market moves against you. In this blog post, we explain how the risk-management features on Deriv&rsquo;s platforms make them excellent choices for trading multipliers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4 ways Deriv gives you more control over your multipliers trade&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>Automatic stop out&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you trade with multipliers on Deriv, you can never lose more than your stake. With an automatic stop out feature, your positions are automatically closed as soon as your losses are equal to your stake amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take profit</h3>\n<p>Usually, you will need to close your position manually to secure your profit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The take profit feature allows you to automate this process. All you have to do is set a level of profit you&rsquo;d be satisfied with. If your profit reaches or exceeds this amount, your position will be closed and your profit will be added to your account balance.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stop loss</h3>\n<p>Stop loss lets you set exactly how much you are willing to risk. You can cut your losses before you lose your entire stake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever your loss equals or exceeds your stop loss amount, your trade will be closed automatically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you open a trade with a 10 USD stake. The automatic stop out will close your trade when your losses reach 10 USD. However, if you want to minimise losses even further, you can set a stop loss level of 5 USD. When your loss reaches this amount, your trade will automatically close.</p>\n<h3>Deal cancellation</h3>\n<p>Opened a trade, but having second thoughts? With deal cancellation, you have the option to cancel a trade within a selected time period (depending on the market and asset you&rsquo;re trading) after opening it and reclaim your stake. Please note that Deriv charges a small fee for this service.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>With these 4 risk-management features, trading multipliers on Deriv can help you avoid missing out on opportunities and prevent you from losing more than you're willing to lose. <a href=\"https://oauth.deriv.com/oauth2/authorize?app_id=16929&amp;l=en&amp;brand=deriv&amp;date_first_contact=2021-06-07&amp;signup_device=desktop&amp;utm_source=deriv_direct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Log in</a> or <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sign up for a free demo account</a> to give Deriv multipliers a try.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>The deal cancellation feature is not available on multipliers on cryptocurrencies for users residing within the EU.</em></p>","author":{"id":"0d7772f6-5338-488f-a8aa-adfb6c5074b9","name":"The Deriv team","image":{"id":"9826d676-357b-4683-8f80-28a4ef931f91","description":"Deriv Logo","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}},"main_image":{"id":"d6bdd2de-27f1-448c-9bbf-c32837470612","description":"Learn how to manage your risk when trading Deriv multipliers","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}},"og_image":null,"tags":[{"id":"61","tags_id":{"id":"6589f95c-df85-4e3a-8cc0-c2d68a5d854f","tag_name":"Multipliers"}}],"footer_banners":{"id":"10","cta_url":"https://deriv.com/markets/stock/","name":"Stocks CFD MT5","desktop_banner_image":{"id":"fe18c9b8-01a2-4356-b4c2-0f6703d6de5d","description":"Trade Stocks with CFDs on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}},"mobile_banner_image":{"id":"cca870eb-6c48-49cf-9828-c60e80426f8c","description":"Trade Stocks with CFDs on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}},"side_banners":{"id":"be65cb26-657c-47b2-8665-264f1d382c8b","cta_url":"https://deriv.com/trade-types/multiplier/","name":"Multipliers vertical","banner_image":{"id":"d39f5b1c-0ab4-4eb4-b647-e9ffb01bcace","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"locale":"en","pathname":"/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/","slug":"risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2998272888","3480019573","663631165","764694655"]}
