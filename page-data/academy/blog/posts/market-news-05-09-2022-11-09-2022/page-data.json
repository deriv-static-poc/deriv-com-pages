Despite sluggish growth, US macroeconomic indicators indicate economic progress is continuing, easing some of the Federal Reserve's burden. Even though the Fed acknowledged that its macroeconomic policy negatively affects household and business expenses, it reaffirmed its commitment to taming inflation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to EU policymakers, the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to tighten the monetary policy more aggressively, leading traders to increase the odds of an ECB rate hike to 75 basis points in September. This news led to a spike in government bond rates, while bond prices fell throughout Europe.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, on the GBP/USD front, the bleak UK economic picture continued to weigh on the native currency along with the escalating energy and cost-of-living crises.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, ECB officials will hold their monetary policy meeting, and traders will finally learn whether the ECB has leaned towards managing inflation or protecting fragile growth. Also, something to look forward to would be the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong><strong><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f1a51a25-8db7-470c-a348-7e827c48c8a5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f1a51a25-8db7-470c-a348-7e827c48c8a5?width=1619&amp;height=808\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The yellow metal recovered most of its previous day's losses but replicated its lowest level in the last 2 months. The spot prices reached new daily highs on Friday to close the week above the $1,700 level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dollar-denominated commodity found some strength due to 2 factors. First, the US dollar dropped from a two-decade high ahead of the closely watched US jobs report. Second, the mild drop in US Treasury bond yields after the release of the non-farm payrolls report further helped support its growth.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold crossed just above its resistance level of $1,710 at the end of the week, making this price the new support level. With the next Fed Reserve's rate decision less than 3 weeks away, traders await the outcome as the US dollar will be impacted, exerting upward or downward pressure on gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, silver prices reversed from their lowest prices since July 2020 to reach $18.00 ahead of the US non-farm payroll results, snapping out of a five-day downtrend. Traders are on edge for any surprises that could renew the US dollar run-up and hurt the XAG/USD.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong><strong><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/8f9b30c4-09d5-47fd-b0fa-f69465f73397\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/8f9b30c4-09d5-47fd-b0fa-f69465f73397?width=1619&amp;height=814\" alt=\"Bitcoin Chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Following the Fed Chair's hawkish comments, traders seem to consider how rising borrowing rates will affect riskier assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, Bitcoin prices kept hovering around the $20,000 level, with somewhat volatile jumps and dips that resemble an (ECG) electrocardiogram result. The average Bitcoin price last week was $20,001.72, which indicates that there was almost equal movement above and below the mean level.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having said that, at the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $19,905.52 and had stayed below the $20,000 mark throughout the weekend.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies continued to be in turmoil. Litecoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Dash have all experienced continued losses in the past month, except for a spike in mid-August.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum was the stand-out performer last week and is trading slightly below the $1,600 level. Its continued surge can be attributed to the anticipation of an upgrade to its blockchain software.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span><strong><br /></strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US stock markets</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial Avg (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31,318.44</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-964.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.99%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,098.44</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-506.73</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-4.02%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,924.26</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-133.40</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.29%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change and net change (%) are based on the weekly closing price change from Friday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Equity markets fell despite a remarkably stable jobs report on Friday, 2 September 2022.
